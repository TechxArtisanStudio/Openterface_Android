# 🎉 Version Management & Release System

## ✅ What Was Added

### 1. **Bump Version Workflow** (`bump-version.yaml`)
Dedicated workflow for version management:
- **Trigger**: Manual (Actions → Bump Version)
- **Features**:
  - Choose bump type: `patch`, `minor`, or `major`
  - Auto-increments version name (e.g., 1.2.0 → 1.2.1)
  - Auto-increments version code (e.g., 7 → 8)
  - Optionally creates git tag (e.g., v1.2.1)
  - Optionally triggers build workflow
  - Commits changes to main branch

### 2. **Updated Build Package Workflow** (`build-package.yaml`)
Added version bump capability:
- **New Input**: `version_bump` (none/patch/minor/major)
- When triggered manually, you can bump version during build
- Default is "none" (no version change)

### 3. **Create Release Workflow** (`create-release.yaml`)
Already created in previous step:
- Downloads latest build artifacts
- Creates GitHub release with APK/AAB
- Supports pre-release and release types

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For a New Release (Recommended Flow):

#### **Step 1: Bump Version**
```
GitHub → Actions → Bump Version → Run workflow
- Bump type: patch (for bug fixes) or minor (for features)
- Create git tag: ✓ YES
- Trigger build: ✓ YES
```
**Result**: Version bumps from 1.2.0 → 1.2.1, code 7 → 8, builds automatically

#### **Step 2: Wait for Build**
- Build workflow runs automatically
- Creates signed APK & AAB
- Uploads as artifacts

#### **Step 3: Create GitHub Release**
```
GitHub → Actions → Create GitHub Release → Run workflow
- Release type: release (or pre-release for testing)
```
**Result**: GitHub release created with downloadable APK/AAB
**Note**: Tag (v1.2.1) and title are automatically generated from `build.gradle` version

## 📊 Version Bump Types

| Bump Type | When to Use | Example Change |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **patch** | Bug fixes, small improvements | 1.2.0 → 1.2.1 |
| **minor** | New features, no breaking changes | 1.2.0 → 1.3.0 |
| **major** | Breaking changes, major redesign | 1.2.0 → 2.0.0 |

## 🔄 How It Works

### Automatic Version Code Management
- **versionName**: User-facing version (e.g., "1.2.0")
- **versionCode**: Internal counter for Google Play (e.g., 7)
- **Auto-increment**: versionCode always +1 when version bumps
- **No conflicts**: Never reuses version codes

### Example:
```
Current: versionName "1.2.0", versionCode 7

After patch bump:
New: versionName "1.2.1", versionCode 8

After minor bump (from 1.2.1):
New: versionName "1.3.0", versionCode 9

After major bump (from 1.3.0):
New: versionName "2.0.0", versionCode 10
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Commit these changes**:
   ```powershell
   git add .github/workflows/bump-version.yaml
   git add .github/workflows/build-package.yaml
   git add VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md
   git add QUICK_START.md
   git commit -m "Add automated version management system"
   git push
   ```

2. **Test the version bump**:
   - Go to Actions → Bump Version
   - Choose "patch" bump
   - Enable "Create git tag"
   - Enable "Trigger build"
   - Run workflow

3. **Create your first automated release**:
   - After build completes
   - Go to Actions → Create GitHub Release
   - Use the new tag (e.g., v1.2.1)
   - Click Run workflow

## 🆘 Common Tasks

### Just Build (No Version Change)
```
Actions → Openterface Build & Package → Run workflow
- version_bump: none
```

### Version Bump + Build
```
Actions → Bump Version → Run workflow
- Bump type: patch/minor/major
- Create git tag: YES
- Trigger build: YES
```

### Create Release from Existing Build
```
Actions → Create GitHub Release → Run workflow
- Release type: release (or pre-release)
```
**Note**: Tag and title are auto-generated from the version in `build.gradle`

## ✨ Benefits

✅ **No manual version editing** - Workflows handle it automatically  
✅ **No version code conflicts** - Auto-increments safely  
✅ **Semantic versioning** - Follows industry standards  
✅ **Automated tagging** - Git tags created automatically  
✅ **Integrated workflow** - Bump → Build → Release in sequence  
✅ **Error prevention** - Can't reuse version codes  
✅ **Full automation** - One click to release
